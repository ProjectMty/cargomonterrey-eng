      <p>
        Cargo Monterrey grew to serve more than 400 clients every month due to its attention to
        detail and cautious execution of each project. No two projects are alike. While we service a
        lot of clients, we are still a mid-size company with just one level of management. Rest
        assured a manager and even the owners are monitoring your project.
      </p>
      <p>
        We specialize in order fulfillment for small and mid-size companies. Whether you ship 100
        orders a month or 20,000 orders a month, we will fulfill each order quickly and accurately.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do this through inventory management, meticulously planned logistics, strategic
        locations, and constant communication throughout our team.
      </p>
      <p>Enjoy the freedom and the confidence you get when you partner with Cargo Monterrey!</p>
